## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```



```{r}
orders <- read_csv("data/Orders.csv", col_types = cols(Order.Date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y"), 
    Ship.Date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y")))
returns <- read_csv("data/Returns.csv")
```

Check **"Profit"** and **"Sales"** in the dataset, convert these two columns to numeric type. 
```{r}
orders$Profit <- as.numeric(gsub('[$,]', '', orders$Profit))
orders$Sales <- as.numeric(gsub('[$,]', '', orders$Sales))
```

### Problem 2: Inventory Management
- Retailers that depend on seasonal shoppers have a particularly challenging job when it comes to inventory management. Your manager is making plans for next year's inventory.
- He wants you to answer the following questions:
    1. Is there any seasonal trend of inventory in the company?
    2. Is the seasonal trend the same for different categories?

```{r}

orders %>%
  group_by(Order.Date)%>%
  summarise(inventory = sum(Quantity))%>%
  ggplot(aes(Order.Date,inventory))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(title = "Total Orders", x = "Date","Total Items Ordered")

orders %>%
  group_by(Order.Date, Category)%>%
  summarise(inventory = sum(Quantity))%>%
  ggplot(aes(Order.Date,inventory))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_smooth()+
  facet_grid(Category~.)+
  labs(title = "Total Orders", x = "Date","Total Items Ordered")

```

- Your manager required you to give a brief report (**Plots + Interpretations**) on returned orders.

	1. How much profit did we lose due to returns each year?
	2. How many customer returned more than once? more than 5 times?
	3. Which regions are more likely to return orders?
	4. Which categories 
```{r}
#1
combine <- inner_join(returns,orders, by = c("Order ID" = "Order.ID"))

profit_loss <- sum(combine$Profit)

print(paste("Total lost profit on returned orders in dollars:", profit_loss))

#2
combine %>%
  select('Order ID','Customer.Name')%>%
  distinct()%>%
  group_by(Customer.Name)%>%
  summarise(total_returns = n())%>%
  group_by(total_returns) %>%
  summarise(number_customers = n())%>%
  ggplot(aes(total_returns,number_customers))+
    geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+
  geom_text(aes(label=number_customers),  size=3.5, nudge_y = 10)+
  labs(title = "Number of Customers by Number of Returns",
       x = "Total orders returned",
       y = "Number of Customers")

#3
#PERPORTION of orders returned by region
returns_region <- returns %>%
  group_by(Region)%>%
  summarise(total_returns = n())
  
orders_region <- orders %>%
  select(Order.ID, Region) %>%
  distinct()%>%
  group_by(Region)%>%
  summarise(total_orders = n())

g <- inner_join(returns_region, orders_region, by = "Region") %>%
  mutate(per_return = total_returns/total_orders*100)%>%
  ggplot(aes(reorder(Region,per_return), per_return))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(title = "Regions by Percentage of Orders Returned",
       x = "Region",
       y = "Percentage of Orders Returned")


#4  
returns_region <- returns %>%
  group_by(Region)%>%
  summarise(total_returns = n())
  
orders_region <- orders %>%
  select(Order.ID, Region) %>%
  distinct()%>%
  group_by(Region)%>%
  summarise(total_orders = n())

g <- inner_join(returns_region, orders_region, by = "Region") %>%
  mutate(per_return = total_returns/total_orders*100)%>%
  ggplot(aes(reorder(Region,per_return), per_return))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(title = "Regions by Percentage of Orders Returned",
       x = "Region",
       y = "Percentage of Orders Returned")
```



#### Step 2:
- Your manager believes that **how long it took the order to ship** would affect whether the customer would return it or not. 
- He wants you to generate a feature which can measure how long it takes the company to process each order.
- ***Hint:*** Process.Time = Ship.Date - Order.Date

```{r}
ml_data <- left_join(orders, returns, by = c("Order.ID" = "Order ID"))
  
ml_data$Returned[is.na(ml_data$Returned)] <- "No"

ml_data <- ml_data %>%
  mutate(Process.Time = Ship.Date - Order.Date)
  
```


#### Step 3:

- If a product has been returned before, it may be returned again. 
- Let us generate a feature indictes how many times the product has been returned before.
- If it never got returned, we just impute using 0.
- ***Hint:*** Group by different Product.ID
```{r}
ml_data <- ml_data %>%
  mutate(new = if_else(Returned == "Yes",1,0))%>%
  group_by(Product.ID)%>%
  mutate(n_times_returned = sum(new))%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  select(-new)
  
```

### Problem 5: Fitting Models

- You can use any binary classification method you have learned so far.
- Use 80/20 training and test splits to build your model. 
- Double check the column types before you fit the model.
- Only include useful features. i.e all the `ID`s should be excluded from your training set.
- Note that there are only less than 5% of the orders have been returned, so you should consider using the [createDataPartition](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/caret/versions/6.0-80/topics/createDataPartition) function from `caret` package and [StratifiedKfold](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold.html#sklearn-model-selection-stratifiedkfold) from sklearn when running cross-validation.
- Do forget to `set.seed()` before the spilt to make your result reproducible.
- **Note:** We are not looking for the best tuned model in the lab so don't spend too much time on grid search. Focus on model evaluation and the business use case of each model.
