## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```



```{r}
orders <- read_csv("data/Orders.csv", col_types = cols(Order.Date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y"), 
    Ship.Date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y")))
returns <- read_csv("data/Returns.csv")
```

Check **"Profit"** and **"Sales"** in the dataset, convert these two columns to numeric type. 
```{r}
orders$Profit <- as.numeric(gsub('[$,]', '', orders$Profit))
orders$Sales <- as.numeric(gsub('[$,]', '', orders$Sales))
```

### Problem 2: Inventory Management
- Retailers that depend on seasonal shoppers have a particularly challenging job when it comes to inventory management. Your manager is making plans for next year's inventory.
- He wants you to answer the following questions:
    1. Is there any seasonal trend of inventory in the company?
    2. Is the seasonal trend the same for different categories?

```{r}

orders %>%
  group_by(Order.Date)%>%
  summarise(inventory = sum(Quantity))%>%
  ggplot(aes(Order.Date,inventory))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(title = "Total Orders", x = "Date","Total Items Ordered")

```
